# Hello world :wave:
I'm **Gabe** (he/him), a **full stack developer** based in **Portland, Oregon** specializing in react applications and front-end technologies, with expertise in Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind, and responsive design. I have a proven ability to deliver high-quality & visually appealing web applications and skilled in building robust & scalable solutions. I collaborate well with cross-functional design & product teams every step of the way. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and delivering exceptional user experiences.

In my spare time you can find me outside, riding bikes on a variety of different surfaces. When I'm not doing that, I enjoy cooking, baking, hiking, and exploring the PNW with my dog and my partner. As a lifelong learner, space fanatic, and amateur astronomer, I love reading about the universe & the current state of space exploration. 🛰️ 🚀 📡
